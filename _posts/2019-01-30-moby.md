This song and video, by the amazing artist Moby, is great to watch and listen to. But not only that, the video conveys a chilling message about human attachment to and uses of the mobile phone. The people in this video animation are blind to the suffering of a young woman; suffering that is caused by people having posted their phone-captured film of her awkward dancing. 

When she commits suicide, a crowd of people coldly film her plunging to her death, and then walk away. 

At the end, the crowd walks blindly off the edge of a cliff, like lemmings; so fixated on their phones that they donâ€™t look where they are going. 

Are we all walking blindly off a precipice?<br>
Are mobile phones killing our humanity? 

Watch and decide for yourself.
