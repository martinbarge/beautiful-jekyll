I wanted to create a graphic consisting of circles within circles, but with the outermost circle divided precisely into three segments of equal size. 

I chose SVG to do this, and I wanted to learn how some of the basic drawing commands native to SVG. 

Drawing graphics with SVG is quite straightforward.
Rather like the HTML5 canvas element, the SVG tag requires a height and width properties with numerical values to set the drawing area.

In the example below, I set the SVG area to 600 x 600.

The circle requires an (x,y) origin, or centre point, specified as cx and cy coordinates, with a value for each. 
It also requires a radius (r).

As I want my circle to use the maximum size of the SVG area, I set the x,y origin of the circle to 300,300. And I set the radius to 300. To make my circle easy to see, I set the fill colour, using a hexadecimal value: fill="#6a29ea"

So far, the result is this:

<svg height="600" width="600">
  <circle cx="300" cy="300" r="300" stroke="black" stroke-width="0" fill="#6a29ea" />

But then I want to divide my circle into three equal segments, using three lines to mark the divisions. Drawing a line is easy enough: we specify the start point coordinates as x1,y1 and the end point coordinates as x2,y2 , and supply the values we need. 

I know that each line has to begin at the centre of the circle, which is 300,300. So my three lines each begin with x1="300" y1="300". 
Next I need to get the coordinates for the end point of each line. To get each end point, I need to make some cosine and sine calculations. The forumlas I need are:

End point coordinates of a line: 
x = ((cosine x degree of angle) x radius) + radius
x = ((sine x degree of angle) x radius) + radius

Explanation:
To divide the circle (360 degrees) into three, I will divide the circle into 3 x 120 degrees. So whatever first angle I choose for my first line, I then add 120 to each subsequent calculation for the other two lines.

I want my first line to be vertical, so I use 90 degrees as my starting angle. 
To get x: ((cos90 * 300) + 300). This equals 300.
To get y: ((sin90 * 300) + 300). This equals 600.

So I know my x2,y2 coordinates are 300,600. 
So my first line entry is:  line x1="300" y1="300" x2="300" y2="600" style="stroke:rgb(255,255,255);stroke-width:6"

<svg height="600" width="600">
  <circle cx="300" cy="300" r="300" stroke="black" stroke-width="0" fill="#6a29ea" />
  <line x1="300" y1="300" x2="300" y2="600" style="stroke:rgb(255,255,255);stroke-width:6" />
