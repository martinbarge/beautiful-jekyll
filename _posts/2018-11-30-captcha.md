<h2>Why are we asked to identify the buses in this image?</h2>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton" target="_blank">John Naughton</a>, writing in the Observer (18th November 2018) explains that the acronym CAPTCHA means 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'; he then argues that the Turing Test has been turned reversed, in that machines now ask humans to prove that we are not machines.

<p>He further explains that image-based CAPTCHA, like the one shown above, are being used to train machine-learning algorithms for driverless cars. So we humans are training the machines, and as such we are being used as unpaid labour. </p>
