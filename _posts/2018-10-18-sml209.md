This term I have a great group of students on undergraduate module 'SML209: Computers and Languages'. We've been learning to make small websites using GitHub pages. This is a great way for them to learn and for me to teach. Here's my tutorial site so far: [HTML Tutorials](https://martinbarge.github.io/sml209-18-sts/).

I have high hopes for this year's group.
