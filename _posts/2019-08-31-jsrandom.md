title: Random Idioms with JS

This small example displays a random item of text pulled from an array of items. In this example, I've included a small number of colour idioms to illustrate. When the page loads, a JavaScript function call displays an idiom on the page, as shown below.

In the example, I've included a button for the user to load another random idiom. The array of idioms is quite small, as this is only an illustration, so there will necessarily be some repetition.

<p><strong>Display a random colour idiom</strong></p>
<dl id="quote"></dl>
<script src="../myscripts/script.js"></script>
<button onclick="loadQuote()">See another random idiom</button>
<hr>
