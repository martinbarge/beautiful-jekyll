# About me and my work
## Professional Background

Since 2007, I have worked in multimedia language education, at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary University of London</a>, providing support for computer-assisted language learning in the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf">School of Languages, Linguistics and Film</a>. My roles and responsibilities include guiding and developing the use of technologies for language learning, ensuring that the computer facilities and applications are fully functional, and providing training and support for language teachers and learners.

Before joining the university, I spent fifteen years teaching English as a Foreign Language, working in Istanbul, Madrid and London, during which time I developed an interest in computer-assisted language learning (CALL); this led to my completing a Master's in Educational Technology, at the University of Manchester School of Education, in 2006.
