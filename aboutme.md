My name is Martin. I have the following qualities:

- I enjoy teaching.
- I try to make an effort to present myself well.
- I am not as young as I used to be. I love statements of the obvious.

What else does one need?

### My Interests

I am interested in the way information technology changes society, the ways we think and the ways we perceive the world.  
Sometimes I think it might be more fun to write stories for a living, but this is not the way the cookie crumbles. I prefer the word 'biscuit' to 'cookie'. The biscuit is British. The cookie American. Both are imperialists. We the old. They the new. Like many people these days, I sometimes fear we are losing the old ways. Or do I? And are we?
