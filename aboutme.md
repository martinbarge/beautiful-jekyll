<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Professional Background</h2>

<p>After training as a teacher of English as a Foreign Language in 1992, I taught English in Turkey, Spain and London, during which time I developed an interest in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). It was this interest that led me to take my Master's in Educational Technology at the University of Manchester School of Education.</p>
