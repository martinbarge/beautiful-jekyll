My name is Martin. I have the following qualities:

- I enjoy teaching.
- I always make an effort to present myself well.

What else do you need?

### My Interests

To be honest, I'd rather write for a living than work with technology, but that's not the way the cookie crumbles. I prefer the word biscuit to cookie. The biscuit is British. The cookie American. Both imperialists. We the old; they the new. Like many people these days, I fear we're losing the old ways.
