<h1>Professional Background</h1>

<p>After training as a teacher of English as a Foreign Language in 1992, I taught English in Turkey, Spain and London, during which time I developed an interest in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). It was this interest that led me to take my Master's in Educational Technology at the University of Manchester School of Education.</p>

<p>I joined Queen Mary in 2007, as Technical Director of the Multimedia Language Resource Centre, a facility within the Language Centre that provides computer-assisted language learning resources for the School of Languages, Linguistics and Film.</p>
