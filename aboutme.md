My name is Martin Barge. I have the following qualities:

- I enjoy teaching.
- I'm always make an effort to present myself well.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'd rather write poems for a living than work with technology, but that's not the way the biscuit crumbles - I've avoided the American word Cookie, because 
like a lot of people these days, 
I fear we are losing the old ways.
